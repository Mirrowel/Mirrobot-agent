#!/usr/bin/env bash
# generate-review-kit.sh — self-serve review context kit for ANY PR in this repo.
#
# Called by the bot-reply workflow (pre-session, for the thread's PR) AND by
# the agent itself (any PR number, from any thread - "review PR #42" asked in
# an unrelated issue works identically). Generates everything a review needs:
#   - review type (FIRST / FOLLOW-UP) from THIS agent's last review marker
#   - full diff (+ incremental diff on FOLLOW-UP) as navigable files
#   - head-SHA file for the target PR (kit-scoped, never clobbers the
#     thread's own /tmp/head_sha.txt)
#   - the review instruction sets + review memory, assembled from the SAME
#     trusted parts the pr-review workflow uses, values baked in
#   - the three discussion blocks (previous reviews / history / thread)
#
# Contract:
#   $1      : PR number (required)
#   env in  : GH_TOKEN (required), GITHUB_REPOSITORY (required),
#             BOT_NAMES_JSON (optional; default = this agent's identities),
#             PREVIOUS_BOT_REVIEWS_COUNT (optional, default 1)
#   files   : /tmp/kit/<pr>/... (diffs, head_sha.txt, context.env),
#             /tmp/instructions/review-{first,followup}.md + review-memory.md
#             (kit writes these for the TARGET pr - re-run the kit to switch)
#   stdout  : KIT RESULT summary (type + paths + sizes) - the caller reads
#             this to decide which instruction file to load
#   exit    : 0 success; 1 usage/fetch failure (message on stdout)
