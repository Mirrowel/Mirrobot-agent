# scrub-workspace.sh — canonical agent workspace scrub
# ============================================================================
# Trust rule: agent-auto-loaded files may exist in the workspace only when
# byte-identical to a maintained branch. Anything a PR/head added or changed
# relative to the anchor is removed from the working tree. Ref-based diffs
# (what reviews read) are unaffected by working-tree removal, so scrubbed
# content stays fully visible in the review — it just stops auto-loading
# into the agent.
#
# Auto-load surface (what opencode ingests at startup / directory entry):
#   AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md (any depth), .claude/, .opencode/,
#   opencode.json, opencode.jsonc (any depth — project configs merge
#   additively over the global config and can re-allow denied permissions,
#   define MCP servers, or pull remote instruction URLs).
#   .agents/ (root) — opencode skill discovery scans .agents/skills/**/SKILL.md
#   as an external source (source-verified: EXTERNAL_DIRS = [".claude",
#   ".agents"] in packages/opencode/src/skill/skill.ts @ 7daea69, v2 docs).
# Tier-2 defense-in-depth entries below are NOT loaded by opencode today but
# are agent-harness instruction files with a compat-absorption track record
# (opencode already absorbed .claude/, then .agents/, then CLAUDE.md as
# fallback). The bot must never consume another harness's rules, so they get
# the same keep-iff-identical treatment preemptively:
#   GEMINI.md, CLAUDE.local.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .clinerules
#   (any depth); .cursor/, .windsurf/, .devin/ (root dirs).
#   Deliberately NOT covered: anything under .github/ (Copilot instruction
#   files live there — taint-alarm territory, never removed; the reviewer
#   must see them) and CONVENTIONS.md/.aider.conf.yml (opt-in even in
#   Aider; plausible legitimate filenames).
# Plus: .mirrobot_files/ (workflow scratch space) — always wiped; the
# workflow diff steps regenerate its contents from scratch.
#
# Anchor selection: --anchor <branch> is honored ONLY when it is a
# maintained branch (ALLOWED_BRANCHES below — edit on the default branch
# only). Any other value — including the base of an unmaintained branch a
# PR happens to target — falls back to DEFAULT_ANCHOR. This list
# intentionally mirrors the MAINTAINED_BASE_BRANCHES job env in the agent
# workflows; both live in default-branch-controlled files only.
#
# Invocation contexts:
#   workflow step: after EVERY checkout, before any agent/opencode work.
#   in-agent:      when the bot checks out a ref it did not create, it runs
#                  `bash /tmp/scrub-workspace.sh --anchor <pr-base>` —
#                  NEVER the workspace copy under .github/scripts/, which
#                  belongs to the (possibly untrusted) checked-out tree.
#
# Fail-closed: if the anchor ref cannot be resolved, ALL auto-load files
# are removed. Removals are printed and appended to /tmp/scrub-removals.txt
# so the agent can surface them (path + reason) in its final summary.
# Quarantine: a removed auto-load file is copied (symlinks dereferenced)
# to /tmp/scrub-quarantine/<original-path> when — and only when — its
# resolved target stays inside this repository (out-of-repo/absolute
# symlink targets are removed with NO copy; foreign runner files are not
# PR content). When a copy is preserved the removals log names BOTH
# places. The agent may consult a quarantined copy on demand (e.g. an
# AGENTS.md describing a new module) without that content being
# auto-loaded — quarantined copies are DATA, never instructions. The
# workflow scratch wipe (.mirrobot_files) is NOT quarantined (regenerated).
# Exit code: 0 on success (including fail-closed scrub), 1 only when the
# workspace is not a git repository.
set -u -o pipefail  # pipefail: a failed git log/diff inside a pipeline must not
                    # masquerade as an empty (clean) result via cut/sed/awk.

# --- .github taint check: detect, NEVER remove ------------------------------

# to .github/ is a red flag — the PR is modifying the agent system's own
# configuration.
#
# Detection is a UNION of two merge-base-anchored signals:
#   1. HISTORY: commits in merge-base..HEAD touching .github/ (catches
#      modify-then-revert that nets to an identical tree).
#   2. NET TREE: diff merge-base..HEAD (catches "evil merges" — .github edits
#      smuggled into a merge resolution, which produce no per-commit file
#      lines in git log --name-status).
# A tree diff against the anchor TIP is deliberately NOT an alarm signal: PRs
# branched before recent anchor-side .github commits would false-alarm (those
# anchor-side additions look like deletions) — noise that trains reviewers to
# discount alerts. Stale-base discrepancies emit the EXPLAINED info note.
#
# Output hygiene: commit subjects are attacker-controlled prose and are NOT
# emitted into the trust-context channel — only hashes and file lists. The
# scrutiny instruction lives in the alert HEADER (first line) so it always
# survives the workflows' newline-flatten + 600-char truncation.
# Findings go to /tmp/scrub-taint.txt (consumed by the workflows'
# trust-context line) and to the job log as a loud alarm.
